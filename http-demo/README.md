## http-demo

This demonstrates using both the DOM and HTTP drivers to create a simple autocomplete search.

### Usage

```
npm install
npm start    # Builds the demo and hosts it on port 3000.
```

### Things to Try

1. An autocomplete search can get rather noisy, so add some debouncing.
300ms ought to do it. (see the code for a way to do it)
